        <h2>
          My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>
          I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was
          I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want
          to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
        </p>
        <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong>
          I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved
          into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I
          didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
        </p>

        <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm
          less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>felt like I had no choice but
            to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living
          a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
